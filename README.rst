Help wanted!
============

I lack both the time and interest to maintain and develop latexdiffcite further. Give me a holler if you want to take over.

What is `latexdiffcite`?
========================

`latexdiffcite` is a wrapper around `latexdiff` to make citations diff properly:

.. image:: https://latexdiffcite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/illustration.png

`latexdiffcite` is a wrapper around `latexdiff` which, before calling `latexdiff`, replaces (in temporary files!) citation commands such as ``\cite{...}`` with written-out formatted references. It does this by looking up references in a corresponding ``.bib`` file or ``.bbl`` file and formatting them according to a user-specifiable configuration. `latexdiff` will then properly mark changes in the citations. The citation format can be heavily customized to match what you are already getting from LaTeX/BibTeX.


Quick start
===========

`latexdiff` is required, but you of course already have that installed and working, right? :-)

Install with ``pip``::

    pip install latexdiffcite

To compare two ``.tex`` files on disk, use the ``file`` subcommand like this::

    latexdiffcite file FILE_OLD FILE_NEW

To compare two revisions (commit hash, tag, branch, etc.) of a ``.tex`` file in a git repository, use the ``git`` subcommand like this::

    latexdiffcite git FILE REV_OLD [REV_NEW] [FILE_NEW]

* ``REV_OLD`` and ``REV_NEW`` can be commit hashes, tags, branches, etc.
* ``REV_NEW`` is optional, and defaults to ``HEAD`` (the latest committed version).
* ``FILE_NEW`` is optional, and is used when the new filename/path is different than the old
